    longDescription: 'Our pressure washing service uses powerful, controlled water jets to remove stubborn dirt, grime, moss, algae, and stains from hard surfaces. This method is ideal for driveways, patios, pathways, and other durable outdoor areas that can withstand high-pressure cleaning.',
    whatIs: 'Pressure washing is a cleaning method that uses high-pressure water spray to remove loose paint, mould, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces. The pressure is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch), and professional equipment can deliver water at pressures far exceeding a standard garden hose.',
    whyNeeded: 'Over time, outdoor surfaces accumulate organic matter, dirt, and stains that regular cleaning cannot remove. This buildup not only looks unsightly but can also make surfaces slippery and hazardous. Moss and algae can cause long-term damage if left untreated. Regular pressure washing maintains your property\'s appearance and safety.',
    howDone: 'We begin by assessing the surface to determine the appropriate pressure level. Our technicians use professional-grade pressure washing equipment with adjustable settings. We systematically clean the entire area, paying extra attention to heavily soiled spots. For surfaces that require it, we apply pre-treatment solutions to break down stubborn stains.',
    whenNeeded: 'Most hard surfaces benefit from pressure washing every 12-18 months, depending on environmental factors. Properties with heavy tree coverage or in shaded areas may need more frequent cleaning due to faster moss and algae growth.',
    surfaces: ['Block paving', 'Concrete driveways', 'Natural stone', 'Brick paths', 'Tarmac areas', 'Garden patios'],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Will pressure washing damage my paving?', a: 'When performed correctly by professionals, pressure washing is safe for most hard surfaces. We adjust the pressure based on the surface type to prevent damage.' },
      { q: 'How long does pressure washing take?', a: 'A typical driveway takes 2-4 hours depending on size and condition. We can provide a time estimate during your free quote.' },
      { q: 'Do you re-sand block paving after cleaning?', a: 'Yes, we offer kiln-dried sand re-sanding as part of our driveway cleaning service to keep your block paving stable and looking great.' },

    longDescription: 'Your driveway is one of the first things visitors see. Our driveway cleaning service removes years of built-up dirt, oil stains, moss, and weeds, restoring your driveway to its original appearance. We work with all driveway types including block paving, concrete, tarmac, and natural stone.',
    whatIs: 'Driveway cleaning is a comprehensive exterior cleaning service that combines pressure washing, surface treatment, and finishing work to completely rejuvenate your driveway. Unlike a quick jet wash, professional driveway cleaning addresses stains, moss, weeds, and general deterioration.',
    whyNeeded: 'A dirty driveway affects your property\'s curb appeal and value. Moss and algae make surfaces dangerously slippery, especially in wet conditions. Oil stains and tyre marks become harder to remove the longer they\'re left. Professional cleaning extends the life of your driveway by removing damaging organic growth.',
    howDone: 'We start with a thorough inspection to identify stains, damage, and growth. Weeds are treated or removed. We apply appropriate pre-treatment solutions for oil stains and organic matter. The entire surface is then pressure washed using commercial equipment. For block paving, we finish with kiln-dried sand to stabilise the blocks.',
    whenNeeded: 'Annual or bi-annual cleaning is recommended for most driveways. Properties with heavy vehicle use, tree coverage, or north-facing aspects may benefit from more frequent cleaning.',
    surfaces: ['Block paving', 'Imprinted concrete', 'Natural flagstones', 'Concrete', 'Tarmac', 'Resin-bound surfaces'],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Can you remove oil stains from my driveway?', a: 'Yes, we use specialist degreasing agents that effectively remove most oil and petroleum stains. Very old or deep stains may lighten significantly rather than disappear completely.' },
      { q: 'Will cleaning my driveway disturb my plants?', a: 'We take care to protect adjacent plants and garden areas. We can use barriers and adjust our techniques near flower beds.' },
      { q: 'How soon can I use my driveway after cleaning?', a: 'You can walk on the driveway immediately. We recommend waiting 24 hours before parking vehicles, especially if re-sanding has been done.' },

    longDescription: 'Roof cleaning removes unsightly moss, lichen, and algae that can damage your roof tiles over time. We use safe, low-pressure soft washing techniques combined with biocidal treatments to clean your roof without causing damage to tiles or disturbing the roof structure.',
    whatIs: 'Roof cleaning is a specialist service that removes organic growth from roof tiles using low-pressure methods and biocidal treatments. Unlike aggressive pressure washing (which can damage tiles), soft washing gently cleans while killing moss and algae at the root to prevent quick regrowth.',
    whyNeeded: 'Moss and lichen retain moisture, which can lead to frost damage in winter. The roots penetrate between tiles, potentially lifting them and causing leaks. A moss-covered roof is also less energy-efficient as it affects water drainage and ventilation. Regular cleaning protects your roof investment.',
    howDone: 'We begin with a physical scrape to remove thick moss deposits. A low-pressure wash then cleans the tiles without forcing water under them. Finally, we apply a professional biocide treatment that continues working for months, preventing regrowth and keeping your roof clean longer.',
    whenNeeded: 'Most roofs benefit from cleaning every 3-5 years, depending on location and exposure. Properties under or near trees, or in damp, shaded areas, may need more frequent attention.',
    surfaces: ['Concrete tiles', 'Clay tiles', 'Slate roofs', 'Flat roofs', 'UPVC fascias', 'Conservatory roofs'],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Is roof cleaning safe?', a: 'Yes, when done professionally. We use low-pressure techniques and take all necessary safety precautions. We never high-pressure wash roof tiles.' },
      { q: 'Will you need to access my loft?', a: 'Usually not. We work from the outside using appropriate access equipment. We\'ll discuss any specific requirements during the quote.' },
      { q: 'How long does the biocide treatment last?', a: 'Our biocide treatment continues working for 12-18 months, significantly slowing any regrowth and keeping your roof cleaner for longer.' },

    longDescription: 'Blocked gutters can cause serious water damage to your property, including damp walls, foundation problems, and fascia damage. Our gutter cleaning service removes leaves, moss, and debris to ensure your gutters drain properly and protect your home.',
    whatIs: 'Gutter cleaning involves the removal of accumulated debris—leaves, moss, sediment, and other materials—from your guttering system. This includes the gutters themselves, downpipes, and outlets. Clean gutters ensure rainwater flows away from your property as designed.',
    whyNeeded: 'Blocked gutters overflow, sending water down your walls instead of through the drainage system. This causes damp, staining, and can damage brickwork and foundations. In winter, blocked gutters can freeze, potentially cracking the gutter itself. Regular cleaning prevents costly repairs.',
    howDone: 'We use professional gutter vacuum systems that safely remove debris from ground level or stable ladders where needed. All debris is collected and removed from your property. We check downpipes are flowing freely and can flush the system if blockages are found.',
    whenNeeded: 'Gutters should be cleaned at least once per year, ideally in late autumn after leaves have fallen. Properties with overhanging trees may need cleaning twice yearly—autumn and spring.',
    surfaces: ['UPVC gutters', 'Cast iron gutters', 'Aluminium gutters', 'Plastic downpipes', 'Box gutters', 'Valley gutters'],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'How do you access high gutters?', a: 'We use professional vacuum systems with carbon fibre poles that reach up to 12 metres, allowing safe cleaning from the ground. For complex access, we use appropriate ladder or access equipment.' },
      { q: 'What do you do with the debris?', a: 'All debris is collected and removed from your property. We leave your grounds clean and tidy.' },
      { q: 'Can you repair damaged gutters?', a: 'We can advise on gutter condition and recommend repairs if needed. Minor adjustments can often be made during the cleaning visit.' },

    whatIs: 'Modern window cleaning uses pure water technology—water that has been purified to remove all minerals and impurities. When applied through special water-fed poles, pure water attracts and removes dirt, then evaporates leaving no residue or streaks.',
    whyNeeded: 'Clean windows improve your property\'s appearance and allow more natural light inside. Dirty windows accumulate more dirt over time, and mineral deposits from rainwater can etch glass if left too long. Regular cleaning maintains your windows in good condition.',
    howDone: 'We use water-fed pole systems that deliver purified water to your windows from ground level. The soft brush head gently agitates dirt while pure water rinses it away. Frames and sills are cleaned at the same time. The pure water dries naturally without leaving marks.',
    whenNeeded: 'Residential windows typically benefit from monthly or bi-monthly cleaning. Commercial properties often need more frequent service. We offer regular cleaning schedules to suit your needs.',
    surfaces: ['House windows', 'Conservatory glass', 'Skylights', 'Commercial glazing', 'Shop fronts', 'UPVC frames'],
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Why does the water dry without marks?', a: 'Pure water contains no dissolved minerals, so when it evaporates there\'s nothing left behind to cause spots or streaks. It\'s the most effective method for achieving a spotless finish.' },

    whatIs: 'Render cleaning is a specialist soft washing service for external rendered walls. Unlike painted surfaces, render is porous and requires gentle cleaning with appropriate chemicals that break down biological growth and pollution staining without damaging the render finish.',
    whyNeeded: 'Algae and biological growth thrive on render, especially on north-facing or shaded walls. Red and green algae staining is unsightly and suggests dampness. Pollution deposits from traffic and industry also accumulate over time. Professional cleaning restores your property\'s appearance.',
    howDone: 'We apply a gentle, render-safe cleaning solution that kills algae and loosens pollution deposits. After allowing the solution to work, we use low-pressure washing to rinse the surface clean. A biocide treatment can be applied to slow regrowth.',
    whenNeeded: 'Render typically needs cleaning every 2-4 years depending on location and exposure. Early treatment when staining first appears prevents deep penetration and makes future cleaning easier.',

    faqs: [
      { q: 'How is soft washing different from pressure washing?', a: 'Soft washing uses low pressure (under 100 PSI) combined with cleaning solutions, while pressure washing relies on high-pressure jets (3000+ PSI). Soft washing is safer for delicate surfaces and more effective at killing organic growth.' },
      { q: 'Is soft washing environmentally friendly?', a: 'Yes, we use biodegradable, environmentally-approved cleaning solutions. These break down safely and don\'t harm plants, pets, or waterways.' },
      { q: 'How long do the results last?', a: 'The biocidal treatment continues working for 12-18 months, significantly slowing regrowth. Most properties stay cleaner for 2-3 years after soft washing.' },
